# “Use Case First" check list

🧭 Use Case & Goal Alignment — GenAI Agent Project (Phase 1 Prep)

Before building infrastructure, re-anchor your project on its business purpose. Every tool, agent, and Bicep module should serve a specific enterprise outcome—not just be deployed for its own sake.

🔁 Re-anchor on the Use Case First (Back to Charter)

Phase 1 must begin by reaffirming the project’s purpose, users, and constraints. Why? Because these dictate:

✅ What kind of storage or memory you need (Blob, CosmosDB, none?)

✅ Whether you need agents to run continuously (Container Apps, Logic Apps)

✅ Whether real-time interaction is required (API endpoints or batch)

✅ What must be secured (Key Vault, RBAC, Private Link, PII)

✅ Which services are worth the cost (OpenAI vs Azure ML vs OSS)

🧠 AIMate Use Case Alignment Questions

> Use this checklist at the start of every project. Answer them once, and AIMate will tailor infra, code, and orchestration accordingly.




---

1. 🎯 Define the Problem / Project Goal

What inefficiency, bottleneck, or opportunity are we solving?

What task currently takes too much time, money, or effort?

What measurable change would this system bring?


Example:

> "Speed up compliance report drafting using multi-agent summarization and real-time retrieval."




---

2. 👥 Identify the Target Users

Who interacts with the system?

Are they technical or non-technical?

Do they initiate actions or only receive results?


Example:

> "Internal legal analysts and compliance officers."




---

3. 🔁 Define the Interaction Type

Chat-based? API-driven? Embedded in a portal?

Synchronous (chat/API) or asynchronous (batch/reporting)?

How is input gathered and output delivered?


Example:

> "Users chat with a FastAPI endpoint that calls orchestrated agents."




---

4. 🧠 Estimate Agent Roles & Count

How many specialized agents are required?

What distinct capabilities or responsibilities do they each have?


Example:

RetrieverAgent → fetches documents

SummarizerAgent → condenses findings

RiskScorerAgent → flags critical points



---

5. 🔒 Specify Constraints

Budget (tokens, infra, storage)?

Compliance or legal boundaries? (e.g., must stay in EU, no PII exposure)

Latency, reliability, or security expectations?


Example:

> "Max $500/month, all compute/data must remain in EU region, redact PII."
